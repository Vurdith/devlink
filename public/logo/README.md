# DevLink Logo Upload

Drop your DevLink logo files here!

## Instructions:
1. **Drop your logo file** into this folder
2. **Name it `logo.png`** (or `logo.jpg`, `logo.svg`, etc.)
3. **I'll integrate it** into the website's branding

## Recommended:
- **Format**: PNG with transparent background
- **Size**: 200x50px or similar aspect ratio
- **File name**: `logo.png` (or `logo.svg` for vector)

## What I'll do:
- Replace the current DevLink branding in the navbar
- Update the favicon
- Use it throughout the site where the DevLink logo appears

Just drop your logo file here and let me know when it's ready!
